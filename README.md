## Why use programming in finance?

Have you ever wondered, how you're going to apply all the fancy formulas you have learned or are going to learn in your studies? 

This is the right place to start, if you are unsure where to begin. And the good news is: how well you learn to apply your theoretical knowledge depends solely on you!

Generally speaking, you can either repeat the same calculations with varying numbers over and over again or you choose the lazier, but more efficien method of telling a computer how to do the job. Of course the latter option requires time investment in the beginning due to the calories you have to feed your brain to systematically analyze the problem at hand. Your computer has a hard time understanding instructions from a text like this, but if you formulate a problem with a set of instructions of any language your computer can understand, you will behold true magic. You will suddenly be able to condense hours, days or even weeks of thinking into a few lines of code and execute tasks with ease in a fraction of the time you would need without a computer. And even better, during this process, your programming toolkit will grow and you will eventually become more and more efficient. 

## Okay, but I learned Excel in my Studies. That does the job.


Excel can tackle a variety of different tasks, that's why you'll come across the software in almost every office environment. But with increasingly complex analyses of bigger datasets, the Excel workflow quickly becomes less reliable and manageable. This is not to say you shouldn't use Excel at all. It is useful AND expected to know Excel in the Finance industry. Use it to handle the easy tasks, but as soon as you need two or more lines of Excel formulas in a cell, you'd probably be better off handling the task in a more manageable framework, such as R or Python.
